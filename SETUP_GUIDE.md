## Files That Need to Be Copied

### From Your Mac to GitHub Repository

Based on your local paths, you need to copy these files from:
`/Users/jonasklotsche/Documents/Documents - MacBook Jonas/MunichQuestNative/MunichQuest/MunichQuest/`

To the corresponding locations in your GitHub repository clone.

### 📁 Models/ (2 files)
- ✗ `Location.swift`
- ✗ `UserProgress.swift`

### 📁 Services/ (3 files)
- ✗ `AuthManager.swift`
- ✗ `GameManager.swift`
- ✗ `LocationManager.swift`

### 📁 Views/ (10 files)
- ✗ `HelpView.swift`
- ✗ `LocationDetailSheet.swift`
- ✗ `LoginView.swift`
- ✗ `MainTabView.swift`
- ✗ `MapView.swift`
- ✗ `QuizView.swift`
- ✗ `SignupView.swift`
- ✗ `SocialView.swift`
- ✗ `StatsView.swift`
- ✗ `WelcomeView.swift`

### 📁 Resources/ (1 file)
- ✗ `locations.json`

### 📁 App/ (folder structure)
- Need to check what's in `App/Munich/` folder

### 📄 Root MunichQuest/ folder
- ✗ `GoogleService-Info.plist` (Firebase configuration)
- ⚠️  `MunichQuestApp.swift` (update with your actual implementation)

## Files to EXCLUDE (Already in .gitignore) ✓
- ❌ `Pods/` - CocoaPods dependencies (will be reinstalled via `pod install`)
- ❌ `DerivedData/` - Build artifacts
- ❌ `*.app` files - Build products
- ❌ `.xcworkspace` - Generated by CocoaPods

## How to Upload Your Files

### Option 1: Using Git on Your Mac (Recommended)
1. Open Terminal on your Mac
2. Navigate to your project:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/jonasklotsche/Documents/Documents - MacBook Jonas/MunichQuestNative"
   ```
3. Check if this is a git repository:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
4. If it's not connected to GitHub yet, add the remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   ```
5. Add all source files:
   ```bash
   git add MunichQuest/
   git commit -m "Add complete app source code with all views, models, and services"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Copy
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your Mac in a different location
2. Copy the files from your local project to the cloned repository
3. Commit and push

## Next Steps After Upload
1. ✅ Create `.gitignore` - Done
2. ✅ Create directory structure - Done
3. ⏳ Copy your source files
4. ⏳ Commit and push to GitHub
5. ⏳ Verify all files are on GitHub
6. Add `Podfile` to repository (for CocoaPods dependencies)
7. Update README.md with setup instructions

## Verification Checklist
After uploading, verify on GitHub that you can see:
- [ ] All Swift files in Models/, Services/, Views/ folders
- [ ] locations.json in Resources/
- [ ] GoogleService-Info.plist (if you want to share it - be careful with sensitive data)
- [ ] Updated MunichQuestApp.swift
- [ ] No Pods/ folder (should be gitignored)

**Note**: The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude build artifacts and dependencies, keeping your repository clean and focused on source code.
